It was the parents anniversary I think. The father had no gift for the mother so he used their son's art piece as a gift. The art piece was of some sort of anime\/ecchi drawing done by the son. I do remember the mother and the father had accents similar to a British accent. At the end of the ad the website name was displayed where you could watch this show. The website name was something along the lines of \"Seeson\" or something like that.
