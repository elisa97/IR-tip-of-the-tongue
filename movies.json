From what I can remember there was a team of people in a space station or research lab or something, like a scifi-ish environment. They were fighting a monster that was humanoid. I remember it looking sort of like Edward Scissorhands but that could also be wrong. I don't remember any of the story, but I think when they finally kill the monster it screams like all hell and there is a big fire or big explosion or something. I remember that you see the monsterguy with the fire in the background as he is screaming.\n\nI know this is extremely vague, but any ideas would be appreciated.

It would have been in the 90s, and I believe it was airing on the TV, not a rented movie, but I could be wrong. I only remember two scenes:\n\n- Main Character (adult dude with dark hair) is with some woman outside (maybe in a garden?) and he's playing with some toy\/trinket\/thing: a disc with strings attached on either end of it, on one side of the disc is a picture of a bird and on the other is a picture of a cage, so when you pull on the strings it causes the disc to spin and makes it look like a bird in a cage.\n\n- One of the victims of whatever bad guy or monster is in the movie is given an autopsy by Main Character Dude (I think she was exhumed for it) and he discovers she was pregnant. I seem to remember him stepping out of the building covered in blood from the autopsy to announce this fact to the townsfolk waiting there...\n\nThat's really it, other than basic settings and stuff like that; I remember it being in an older setting (Victorian era, maybe?), and there were definitely scenes where the victim(s) were chased by the bad guy through woods or dirt roads in woods. \n\nMy parents remembered my existence at one point partway through and sent me to bed, so I don't have much info...

She starts to feel sick in an airport and within a few days she dies. Unfortunately, she spread the disease to other people while gambling in Macau and waiting in the airport. Many more people start to contract it (including her children), but her husband is unharmed throughout the movie. As more people become affected, there are spliced in scenes of people at WHO discussing making a cure, blah,blah,blah. There's a subplot of an internet blogger who says the government is hiding stuff and that he has a (fake) cure.

I think the movie might have the word 'Blue' in the title, or talking about a bird or something.\n\nScene 1: (Scenes aren't in any particular order. I'm just numbering them as I go.):\nThe main characters went to this place that was all white, and may or may not be up in the clouds. Anyway, there, there were all the children that have not yet been born. There were two children that have been there for years and were now teenagers who fell in love. One of them got called to go on a boat to go to earth as a newborn, and they were sobbing uncontrollably, facing the reality that they had to be separated. \n\nScene 2: I remember the two kids who were visiting their grandparents grave, and they prayed that they wanted to see them again. Then I guess their prayer got answered and they walked up to heaven. The boy met his grandpa and I think they made a birdhouse. The girl and the grandma were in the house and the grandma was talking about how everything in heaven is perfect, and proceeded to change the time with her mind or some crap.\n\nScene 3: I'm not sure if this is from the same movie or not, but I remember a horrible forest fire that all 4 of the characters were trying to escape.\n\nPlease help me figure this out!

I only remember a few scenes from this movie. Here&amp;#39;s some background information though: The movie is about 2 kids, one boy one girl, and their pets. The cat turned into a woman I believe, while the dog turned into a man. I think the movie might have the word &amp;#39;Blue&amp;#39; in the title, or talking about a bird or something.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scene 1: (Scenes aren&amp;#39;t in any particular order. I&amp;#39;m just numbering them as I go.):\nThe main characters went to this place that was all white, and may or may not be up in the clouds. Anyway, there, there were all the children that have not yet been born. There were two children that have been there for years and were now teenagers who fell in love. One of them got called to go on a boat to go to earth as a newborn, and they were sobbing uncontrollably, facing the reality that they had to be separated. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scene 2: I remember the two kids who were visiting their grandparents grave, and they prayed that they wanted to see them again. Then I guess their prayer got answered and they walked up to heaven. The boy met his grandpa and I think they made a birdhouse. The girl and the grandma were in the house and the grandma was talking about how everything in heaven is perfect, and proceeded to change the time with her mind or some crap.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scene 3: I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is from the same movie or not, but I remember a horrible forest fire that all 4 of the characters were trying to escape.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please help me figure this out!

It's a action\/martial arts movie, and I seem to remember some sick fight scenes that I really want to revisit again. \n\nIt starts of with some scenes about illegal organ trade in Hong Kong, with scenes including a ice box and a voiceover talking about kidnappings and missing people per year. A main character is a policeman from HK mistakenly thrown into jail in Vietnam (?? not sure but southeastern asia for sure, maybe singapore), and there's an amazing fight scene where he's trying to get wifi\/data signal from his phone to contact the outside world. \n\nA huge part of the storyline is something about a girl that has some sort of disease\/sickness and needs some special blood to survive, and in the end she gets this blood from the police officer?? There's also this vietnamese (or whatever southeast asian country, sorry if I sound rude) police officer that's a complete savage, perhaps related to the girl, that helps the police officer form Hong Kong. \n\nI vaguely remember the a fight scene where the southeastasian dude is trying to break the policeman out of a place where he is about to be butchered, organs sold, and they get out in a small pickup truck. The end scene includes a fight on some really tall building (indoors) and then in the end they all sorta fall out with someone holding on, not sure how that ends up. The girl also faces a black imaginary wolf somewhere near the end, no idea where that came from.\n\nThanks so much if anyone can find this movie for me, though it might have only been broadcasted in asia so that would make it more difficult to find.\n\nThanks again!","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_4uppcs","gilded":0.0,"archived":0.0,"id":"4uppcs","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"moviethrowaway1231","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/4uppcs\/tomt_movie_recent_actionmartial_arts_movie_with\/","score":1,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1471697581,"parent_id":"t3_4uppcs","author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"d5rssve","distinguished":null,"link_id":"t3_4uppcs","edited":false,"gilded":0,"body":"It sounds kind of like [The Raid 2](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Raid_2)","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"McPhatiusJackson","score":1,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","created_utc":1469557155,"comments":[]},{"link_id":"t3_4uppcs","distinguished":null,"id":"d5rvi36","author_flair_css_class":null,"parent_id":"t3_4uppcs","retrieved_on":1471698933,"ups":2,"created_utc":1469560389,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","author_flair_text":null,"author":"party_squad","score":2,"controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","body":"[Kill Zone 2](http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt3197766\/) starring Tony Jaa.\n\n","gilded":0,"edited":false,"comments":[{"id":"d5sbbny","distinguished":null,"link_id":"t3_4uppcs","parent_id":"t1_d5rvi36","author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1471706491,"created_utc":1469580370,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":null,"score":1,"author":"moviethrowaway1231","subreddit":"tipofmytongue","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","stickied":false,"edited":false,"body":"Thanks so much, this was it!","gilded":0,"comments":[{"created_utc":1469581626,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","controversiality":0,"score":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"party_squad","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","gilded":0,"body":"Happy to hear--definitely has some great scenes.","edited":false,"link_id":"t3_4uppcs","id":"d5sca9r","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"parent_id":"t1_d5sbbny","retrieved_on":1471706944,"ups":1,"comments":[]}]}]}],"banned_by":null,"selftext_html":null,"mod_reports":null,"report_reasons":null,"user_reports":null,"locked":0.0,"preview":null,"post_hint":null,"all_awardings":null,"allow_live_comments":null,"author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_richtext":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":null,"author_fullname":null,"author_patreon_flair":null,"author_premium":null,"can_gild":null,"category":"MOVIE","content_categories":null,"contest_mode":null,"discussion_type":null,"gildings":null,"hidden":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":null,"is_crosspostable":null,"is_meta":null,"is_original_content":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":null,"is_robot_indexable":null,"is_video":null,"link_flair_background_color":null,"link_flair_richtext":null,"link_flair_template_id":null,"link_flair_text_color":null,"link_flair_type":null,"media_only":null,"no_follow":null,"num_crossposts":null,"parent_whitelist_status":null,"pinned":null,"pwls":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":null,"send_replies":null,"spoiler":null,"subreddit_subscribers":null,"subreddit_type":null,"suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":null,"treatment_tags":null,"upvote_ratio":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null,"crosspost_parent":null,"crosspost_parent_list":null,"url_overridden_by_dest":null,"can_mod_post":null,"removal_reason":null,"subreddit_name_prefixed":null,"author_cakeday":null,"awarders":null,"removed_by":null,"view_count":null,"call_to_action":null,"num_reports":null,"likes":null,"clicked":null,"approved_by":null,"brand_safe":null,"mod_note":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"approved_at_utc":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"rte_mode":null,"post_categories":null,"visited":null,"previous_visits":null}

The production values of the show were not that great, so it's unlikely (but possible) it was ever a theatrical release.  Given the styles, I don't think it could have been more than two years old at the time I saw it, and was probably a new release.\n\nMarried couple, late 20s or early 30s, were happily living in Anytown USA.  They go and visit the husband's birthplace or ancestral hometown or something like that.  It might've been on an island off of Massachusetts or Maine.  Once there, they gradually find out that his family line is evil and they (the family) want him to stay.  He eventually succumbs to the takeover.  This takeover could've been one of his ancestors possessing him, or his gradual waking up to the realization that he was a reincarnation of one of his evil ancestors, or  he  finally realizes what kind of person he really is because of who his family is, something like that.  \n\nSo once he's gone down the tubes and is fully evil, she's a target.  She manages to run, hide, and finally escape by rowing a rowboat, alone, across a foggy body of water while the credits roll.  \n\nThe final sequence as she's escaping alone without her husband is reminiscent of this: http:\/\/cache3.asset-cache.net\/gc\/101599131-blue-lake-fog-with-row-boat-gettyimages.jpg\n\nKnowing what I now do about movies as an adult, it's quite possible it was filmed in eastern Canada with Canadian actors, but that's just a guess.\n\nI was a kid and wasn't paying much attention throughout, but by the time it got to that last scene I found it pretty thoroughly creepy and have thought about it and tried to find it around Halloween ever since.  \n\nNote: This is similar to, but definitely not the same as, the storyline of [Phantasmagoria](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phantasmagoria_(video_game).  The similarities are striking enough for me to think this movie might've inspired Roberta Williams in making the storyline of the game.  Thus far, I haven't found a group of tropes as similar as this that point to an earlier origin.","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_2iuz83","gilded":0.0,"archived":1.0,"id":"2iuz83","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"portlandpuff","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":1412956606.0,"secure_media":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/2iuz83\/tomtmovie_horror_movie_from_around_19891993_a_man\/","score":1,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"author_flair_text":null,"ups":3,"score_hidden":false,"distinguished":null,"archived":false,"name":"t1_cl5q9qh","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","body":"[**Bay Coven** (1987)](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RNz622AIcSQ)\n\nWatch another clip [here](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2xf_JyuwZt8).

A man (I think he was a doctor) travelled to a Bedlam-type mental asylum to work there. His boss gave him a creepy vibe for some reason. The patients were administrated a pill every day which was supposedly for schizophrenia (let's say they were red). \n\nThe protagonist's love interest was a woman who suffered from a mild case of schizophrenia since she was little, but she took pills every day so she hadn't had any symptoms since she was a child. However, to his surprise, her pills are a different a colour (let's say they were blue), so he points this out. She says it's because the patients must need a stronger medication. As it turns out, when she takes by accident a red pill, (or she forgets completely, I can't remember what happened there) she starts seeing weird shit everywhere.

Then she started having family troubles with her dad mainly and stayed at his house, coupled with his own troubles leading to a rather strained relationship and they may have split up but got back together at some point. I also recall him having a conversation with his dad at some point trying to call him out on his flaws, but his dad basically shook it off and he got pissed and stormed out.

One of the Japanese soldiers\/commanders is severely injured (in the forehead I think), but he decides to give his medicine to the American soldier instead, because he wants to hear the US soldier's side of the story. They exchange their life stories, and the Jap commander dies soon after while the US soldier lives.\n\nAnother Japanese soldier is forced to crawl amongst the corpses of his comrades and play dead in order to get closer to the American camp.\n\nNot really sure if this is part of the movie, or if I'm mixing it up with another one, but one of the younger soldiers is forced to put down a family's dog because its barking was intercepting radio signals.\n\nI would love to watch the movie again, as I remember it as being a good film.

The movie seems very horror centered but it slow starts to reveal [that the masked guy is the older man, but from the future.

One of which is totally weird, and I want to rewatch it to experience it again. \n\nFor years I had thought it was called \"Guppy\", but everytime I go to look for it I get nothing. Somewhat recently it hit me that it may have been a bad memory translation and the movie title could have been \"Flounder\", which my young mind associated with a Guppy ala little mermaid. Also flounder made more sense for the movie plot\/story, a dude waisting his time away. But again cannot find it with that name either. Too much other stuff when I search plot, which makes me think this was from a small studio. \n\nHere is the story\/plot (NSFW gross stuff warning); \n\nA loser dude living in L.A. CA (I think). Just lost to the world, disconnected, blonde hair, late 20s maybe. I think the movie starts with his own narration how his life sucks. And maybe the only thrills anymore is waiting to see his neighbor coming home to their apartment building, so he can mentally masturbate to her.  I think he literally does it watching her out the window at some point, but you don't see his wang.\n\nSome key moments:\n \n* He stopped at a red light and looked over at the next car to find a gun pointing in his face by some street gang. They shrugged like it was a joke and sped off. He was still there looking straight in shock. \n\n* He lets himself go and ends up being too involved with drugs to where he became homeless for a stint. Befriended some reckless people?\n\n* He was liking his new \"I don't give a fuck\" self, and starting just doing whatever he wants. Had sex with a former lover in a bathroom doing coke. \n\n* He snaps and needs to leave LA like now, and kidnaps his neighbor on the way out of town. \n\nI don't remember how it ends but I really loved the credits. It was all the people involved in the film waving at the camera in the locations it was filmed around LA (again I think Los Angeles). Maybe singing\/celebrating in unison all together ala the end of 40 year old virgin.

One of which is totally weird, and I want to rewatch it to experience it again. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For years I had thought it was called &amp;quot;Guppy&amp;quot;, but everytime I go to look for it I get nothing. Somewhat recently it hit me that it may have been a bad memory translation and the movie title could have been &amp;quot;Flounder&amp;quot;, which my young mind associated with a Guppy ala little mermaid. Also flounder made more sense for the movie plot\/story, a dude waisting his time away. But again cannot find it with that name either. Too much other stuff when I search plot, which makes me think this was from a small studio. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the story\/plot (NSFW gross stuff warning); &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A loser dude living in L.A. CA (I think). Just lost to the world, disconnected, blonde hair, late 20s maybe. I think the movie starts with his own narration how his life sucks.

He tries to sing, but since he sings bad they throw him out, where he find a few cute, hairy monsters. Suddenly a army of bigger aliens is coming.

The last few seconds shows the main character singing on stage in the bar and when the audience displays their displeasure, the monsters threaten them and they clap.\n\nI remember all that but my google-fu is to weak to bring in actual results.","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_3konv2","gilded":0.0,"archived":0.0,"id":"3konv2","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"ShikiRyumaho","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":1442108016.0,"secure_media":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/3konv2\/tomtmovie_a_computer_animated_short_movie_with\/","score":5,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"parent_id":"t3_3konv2","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_3konv2","id":"cuz7x38","body":"[*The ChubbChubbs!*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_ChubbChubbs!)","edited":false,"created_utc":"1442083698","author":"teraflop","subreddit":"tipofmytongue","author_flair_css_class":null,"distinguished":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"retrieved_on":1444320815,"gilded":0,"comments":[{"score":2,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1444321022,"ups":2,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","author":"ShikiRyumaho","created_utc":"1442084469","author_flair_css_class":null,"link_id":"t3_3konv2","edited":false,"body":"Oh man, thank you.

The main one I remember had these rectangular protusions from their chests that held a holographic sorta image of different scary looking animals. And when they needed to call on their power, the animal from their chest would project out of that square. And then the human that had projected it would sorta blink out like a video game. and then we understood that they had become that animal. The other faction I don't remember so well. But they had these tall staffs that could project some sort of avatar being that had some sort of immense power. The clearest one I remember is that some village had protected itself with a magical forcefield and a character projected from their staff a being that fired an arrow at the forcefield and destroyed it. He made a comment that it was his \"only arrow\". At some point later some sorcerer character led the staff people back to a magic pool that recharged their staffs. Here's hoping.

The main character is a guy (probably 30-40ish old) who is really oblivious and gets fired quite early on in the movie. Then he starts going somewhere I think (can't remember where or why) and then he needs to hitchhike and the girl who picks him up is narcoleptic and always falls asleep while driving\/walking. Then I think they go to her farm because they have an accident because she fell asleep while driving. When they are in her house they walk into her brother's room and everything is pink in his room and there are tons of pictures of (almost) naked guys. The main character asks the girl if her brother is gay but she says he is definitely not (even tho it's obvious he is). Can't really remember more but I remember it to hilarious so it would be great to find this movie. Also I might be wrong about a few things in this description.

It was dubbed into another languages. House for homeless people played a role in that film too, but i dont remember what was it.\n\nAfaik woman aliens are dominant, it comes from space and at the end the old man throws grenade to destroy the eggs before dying. And there is that room in the building where a man goes and kills the alliens, it leads down to where eggs are. You cant recognize if it's normal guy or alien since they have human skin. Only if they get cut, you can see they arent people. I think they were holding one astronaut too and iirc they were ripping off his nails.\n\nA man went to the Room x (x = i dont know the number) - i tried searching it by this too, but since i dont know the number of the room it's pretty hard. There were a lot of people sitting in the room and something like reception and next to it were white big doors(?) with stairs which led down. Afaik they were saying it's just doctor but people who went there never came back = they were used for skin for the aliens and food for the eggs(?). The man there started complaining where are all the people who went there and never came back, so the reception called bodyguards and there was a shooting in there, which man won. He then went downstairs through the doors and a room where people were where he got disinfected(?) and killed the workers there. He then jumped down the tube since more people were coming and then he was in sewers with a lot of eggs laid down there. He got out through canal on the street.\n\nThanks\n","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_49883r","gilded":0.0,"archived":0.0,"id":"49883r","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":10,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"imousek","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/49883r\/tomt_movie_horrorscifi_film_aliens_with_human\/","score":7,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"link_id":"t3_49883r","retrieved_on":1460472676,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t3_49883r","score":1,"stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"edited":false,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","body":" There is a movie where a group is holding some people captive in the back room of a grocery store and the alien looks just like humans, so they are testing by cutting off pieces of people's bodies and testing their blood.

The setting is way different though, as from what I remember she goes back and ends up in a concentration camp? It's very dramatic, sad, and from memory not at all sci-fi.\n\nI honestly only have a really vague memory, but hopefully someone here can help!

Its an old house, or what used to be, and in a trap door, he finds another kid there. The main character closes the door and is shocked, I wouldn't blame him because the other kid left alone in the trap door is raggedy and dirty(scary for my 13 yr old mind too)\n\nAnyway that is the most certain scene i remember.

The whole story was basically where the professor of the class gave the class a scenario and each person drew from a box that the professor \"randomly\" (inside the scenario) mixed up and the paper they pulled out contained a profession. Inside the scenario, the class experienced a nuclear event and they had a bunker that they could reside in but only for a specified amount of time, at which point the class had to collectively vote who to kick out and basically have die from nuclear radiation. Now the movie technically took place in the classroom, however, to fit the movie it showed this desolate area with a nuclear shelter in the middle of nowhere(ish). Long story (sort of) short, the professor rigged the box the class drew out of to make the female protagonist pull the profession(s) that would keep her from being voted out, and the male protagonist pull something that would essentially get him voted to death each time. The twist comes when the professor reveals to the audience that he and the female had relations and he was jealous of her newfound boyfriend.\n\n\nI really hope someone can figure this out because I am racking my brain trying to figure out who the female protagonist was. Thank you in advance.\n\nedit: Reddit, I can't thank you enough.

Mid-Late 80's Romance movie.\nThe basic set up is - the guy is eventually too perfect - during the course of their relationship he has learned all her quirks. He eventually orders her meals perfectly - impressing her by getting the salad dressing on the side in a cup.\n\nShe dumps him at a that very dinner scene because it illustrates one of the many ways he's too perfect and safe. She has come to believe she needs an exciting unpredictable guy. \n\nI can't recall the outcome of the movie. I think they get back together. What a shocker.\n\nI can't really identify the actor and actress in the film.
