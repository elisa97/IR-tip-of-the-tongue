{"qid":"763","query":"Super Rare Surreal Dystopian Masterpiece Very rare movie that is scifi/dystopian/experimental/surreal. It’s like Stalker meets el Topo meets Holy Mountain meets Alphaville meets Delicatessen meets Hard to be a God, like Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and Lynch had a kid together. It was color, possibly Russian, and I don’t really remember the decade but want to say 60s or 70s, though could easily be more recent. It is VERY rare, there is only one crappy partial print of it, and that is what the youtube version is from. Lot of wide shots in a surreal wilderness, winter settings, strange bleeding saturation in some shots. Crazy costumes. Seriously one of the strangest films I’ve ever seen and my favorite films are strange/weird ones. If you’ve ever seen what you’re thinking of on a “best weird movies” or “you’ve never seen this!” list, that’s NOT it. I don’t think this film even has a cult following of ten people. It’s an actual rare gem. Have been looking through selections at 366 Weird Movies and not found it yet (btw the way most of those titles are exactly the kind of not-actually-rare movies this film is definitely not)."}
{"qid":"802","query":"Male little person falls in love with red-headed woman I hope someone can help me track down this movie. I may have some details mixed up, or combined with another drama, so if you have any suggestions at all, please share them. There is a Caucasian man, who is a little person, who is successful in his working life but is lonely in his private life. He may be a writer or editor, or some such professional. I think part of the plot is that he might have trouble making friends because some people are prejudiced against his size. Sometimes he abuses alcohol because of this. He re-connects with a woman he knew when he was a child, even though she used to tease him back when they were children. They become friends and eventually fall in love. She is a regular height woman, also Caucasian, slim and with red hair. In the last scene of the movie, they are dancing on a balcony or rooftop and she is wearing a white dress. Maybe it’s their wedding? I have been through the filmographies of all the male Caucasian little people actors I can think of with no luck. My Googlefu has failed me as well. If you have any ideas at all, no matter how far fetched, please share them. Thank you in advance for any suggestions you may have."}
