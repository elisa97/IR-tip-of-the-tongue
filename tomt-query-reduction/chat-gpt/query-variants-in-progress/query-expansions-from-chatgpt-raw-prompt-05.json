The resident of the apartment is a man who wears a mask and gloves, never taking them off. He makes her breakfast. The apartment is full of art and statues and books, almost museum-like.

The man was referred to as his cell number, and because of the experiments he developed super immunity to either disease (I think). There was a fire at the place where Mengele did the experiments and the man survived but had burns all over his body hence the mask and gloves. At some point the woman comes back. The police I think are after the masked man. I\u2019m not sure if he gets shot, but they\u2019re in the metro station and at some point the woman puts him (I think he was dying?) on a metro car full of flowers and bombs and sends it off to blow up.

A young girls falls asleep or gets lost while playing with her friends in some tower or water mill type structure.  Her father stays behind searching for her. Two male backpackers traveling across the region wander into the village as the people are fleeing.  They disbelieve the legends told to them or could have not understood the meanings. The cult arrives after the dark falls and begins capturing villagers and hunting down anyone in the area.  Victims caught were hung on a cross and placed before a creature.  It would open its two arms wider revealing a third arm with three fingers extending from its chest.  When placed on the chest of the victim it would burn/brand them leaving a three fingered mark.  They would then become devoted followers. The father ends up being captured later on and he is branded. The two hikers are running down a stone staircase from some cultists when one of them falls.

When people were about to die, they would hear the sea singing to them (I seem to recall that everyone present could hear it, not just the person dying. Also not sure if that was death in general, or just death by foot-worm). 3. There were doctors who would operate on people with \u201cmagic\u201d gloves that would allow them to reach into people\u2019s bodies without making incisions \u2013 there was some sort of training involved, and one of the main characters failed to save someone\u2019s life because he couldn\u2019t get the gloves to penetrate the patient\u2019s skin. 4. It was set in a Victorian-esque setting, with horse drawn carriages 5. There was a firm divide between an area of permanent darkness and an area of light (can\u2019t remember if the light area ever experienced night, but the dark one would never get day) 6. There was a scene where a king (or some such prominent royalty/courtier) was assassinated by having one of the aforementioned worms inserted into his food while he was sleeping (incidentally, this is the reason I cannot to this day sleep without my feet covered. As a kid this movie freaked me out, so no matter how hot it is, my feet must be covered.) 7. I remember a conversation in a carriage about weather balloons.

He went out to a beach (lake or sea?), where suddenly a woman emerges from the the deep water and walks up on the beach. I don\u2019t remember much else apart from there being a portrait of the woman inside the manor house, and that at the end it turns out the woman has been dead for a long time, and she ages very quickly in front of the man, her skin and muscles start melting away and she turns into a skeleton (and dust?).

One is a teacher / scientist that starts stressfully writing on the schoolboard, then crouches and the alien rips out of his back, long black nails first. Second is one where the nails come out of the victims face. I believe the movies starts with a girl jogging in a dark setting, some streetlights and may be foggy. Then the view point changes to something chasing her. Im not sure if what happens next is shown, but an important part in the first few scenes of the movie i also remember is a crime-scene with the two main characters: A woman, seemingly not from earth, covering a big out of space like big gun under a trenchcoat, and a man, probably police officer or FBI who sees that woman and knows something is fishy. The woman is there to catch / kill / recapture the alien. The guy helps her throughout the movie. There are several chasing scenes where people try to get away before being infected by the parasite like alien. I remember a scene that points out that coffee is something the woman has never had.

It is a movie and I\u2019m pretty sure I seen it in around 2010-2013 but I\u2019m not sure. So pretty much this is a love story of complications between this married couple, the husband is the one messing up and the wife is the one who keeps putting up with it. He has an addiction to porn, the wife finds out and I think it really upset her. So the husband goes to his dad for advice, to figure how to fight for someone who doesn\u2019t love you anymore. The dad and mom are very Christian. The dad gives his son the idea of a book of I think 100 things to try and by the end of the book, he should win his wife\u2019s love back. (That\u2019s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back. The plot twist was that, even though the father was giving his son the advice he needed as if he had done the same thing, he actually tells his son that [he] had been the one to lose love for his mother and his mother was the one who had fought to get it back. Then the son goes back into his house where his mother and wife were, crying and apologized and hugged his mom.

We would fall asleep watching the TV. Usually I was the last one to fall asleep and so could watch part of a horror movie until commercials came on and I fell asleep from boredom and the TV would run until morning, or I woke up later and caught the ending and turned off the TV. Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can\u2019t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook\u2026 maybe\u2026 The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn\u2019t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can\u2019t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here\u2019s some conversation they had: Daughter: \u201cWe\u2019ve been passing by that cabin all night\u201d Father: \u201cThis is a military road, all the cabins look the same\u201d *some arguing and desperation* Father: \u201cIf we keep driving we should be OK\u201d *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending\u2026 The father somehow disappeared, can\u2019t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can\u2019t remember. So if it was her family maybe coma, if it wasn\u2019t maybe she was found.

All I recall is just this one scene: The man and the girl are making pancakes (or tortillas), and the man is showing the girl some sort of a trick \u2013 he throws the pancake up into the air, then catches it, then throws and catches it again. At some point, he throws the pancake and it disappears. Then both man and girl lift their eyes and see that the pancake is stuck to the ceiling.

The protagonist and his opponent are fighting on the beach, the hero overcomes his enemy and a wave carries out the pieces of the artifact into the sea. The protagonist is walking sadly along the shore and suddenly finds both pieces thrown ashore by the wave. So he takes these two pieces and moves to some different location continuing his search.

Another scene: a woman desperately clings to and cries in agony as her dead baby is taken away in a carriage (maybe a sled). Another scene: a woman (think she was Asian) and a man (African American) are surrounded by a group of outlaws?, the outlaws stab the man ( I think he was stabbed in the armpit/rib area. The Asian woman is then hung by the outlaws, she was wearing a red dress. I also remember the woman who was shot in the knee living in a house with other women, one of whom has a baby. Woman with the baby considers shooting her child during the Native American attack to spare her child from capture or a more gruesome death. At another point, the slaves or servants (I don\u2019t know if they were slaves but I do remember that they were African American) are hung by the Native Americans (though its possible that someone else hung the slaves.

It\u2019s night time and the boy is running around trying to escape some thing that is chasing him throughout the castle and you can hear his parents screaming.

Little by little, his behavior becomes eratic as he is slowly being possessed by whatever force lives in the castle. Eventually, he starts chasing his girl and is trying to kill her. She eventually makes it down to some hidden area where the mummified remains of some prince is sitting on a throne. Suddenly, the prince gets up and starts shambling towards her. He\u2019s moving really slow since it\u2019s all practical effects. Turns out he\u2019s the one who has been possessing the guy. The prince was young when he died, I think, and wanted the kid to stay with him. That\u2019s why he got rid of the guys parents. So, she\u2019s being chased by both of them. In the end, she manages to get away and I think she ends up killing her boyfriend in order to escape.

The humanoid alien befriends (or is befriended by) a woman in town and they talk in her home.  People start getting killed on the outskirts of town, because some kind of alien creature had gotten aboard the craft, and the creature is hiding in a cave outside town.   When he hears of these killings, the humanoid alien recognizes that these are due to this creature, and he goes to try to kill it.  His hand weapon has been damaged (perhaps by the crash) and won\u2019t work.  He disassembles it on her kitchen table, and finds a part that\u2019s damaged.  He decides that the wires on poles running around town have power that might be able to operate his weapon to kill the creature.   The woman takes him out to the road near the cave, he climbs a telephone pole, cuts the wires and hooks them to his weapon.  She got on a nearby telephone, calls the local power company, where the guy at the power plant switches off the power as the alien is cutting the wires and connecting them to his weapon, and then turns the power back on, at her request over the phone.

The kids (might include teenagers) are missing. And it is because they are being collected by the mysterious cult.

They are being collected because satan is coming back to earth beautifully. The scene i remember: the child is riding a horse in her nightgown and or with or without the man who is investigating.

I don\u2019t remember the name or any of the actors of the movie, but I remember a lot about it. First off, it was animated. It wasn\u2019t super high quality, the people/things looked like silhouettes (you couldn\u2019t see their faces or exact clothing details, but you could see the shadows of them). Second, it was about a boy and a girl acting out these \u201cplays\u201d in an old theater owned by an old man, who may have been their grandfather. There was also an owl in the theater, and it looked at the camera and hooted whenever they changed from one \u201cplay\u201d to another. Third, to change from one costume to another, they stood on a sort of platform thing. It \u201cscanned\u201d them, and the silhouettes of the clothes they described appeared on their bodies. The plays/plots I remember are as follows : Boy gets put in prison (wrongly accused of stealing a necklace, I think), but gets pitied by a princess and she takes him food/clothing. However, the good princess\u2019s evil sister tries to marry the boy when he gets out of prison. When he refuses/realizes she\u2019s the evil princess, she curses him to be a wolf. Boy then eventually gets freed by the good princess. Boy finds himself in a city of gold, but an evil dragon rules the city. The dragon gives the people gold, but only if they sacrifice the most beautiful maiden to the dragon every month/year. Boy eventually slays dragon and marries the girl, who was the most beautiful at that time. Boy is in Africa/similar place and likes to play the drum, but is shunned for doing so. The girl\u2019s father is the clan/tribe chief and is dying from illness. Boy gets thrown out of clan/tribe, but saves an old medicine man from a leopard/big cat. Old medicine man teaches boy how to play drum, which ends up healing the sick clan/tribe chief. The drum also makes the clan/tribe unbeatable in battle. Boy is an adventurer in a strange land where he crawls through a tunnel and gets put in prison. He has to choose/marry one of the king\u2019s three daughters, but he doesn\u2019t know which one. A bee flies around the head of the correct daughter because he fed the bee earlier in the tunnel. He also gets help from other monsters he met in the tunnel/cave.

Most of whom were somewhere around 12-14 years old. And they start covering her in mud and as they do so, they are groping her breasts and ass. Not sure if they were supposed to, but they were.

A boy walks into a room and notices someone sleeping (or dead) and takes an item from them and walks out. He\u2019s shown to be the stereotypical nerd with glasses and a tucked in, button up shirt.

In one class, a bully teases him and he makes a mixture in a beaker and pours it on the bully\u2019s arm. Turns out it was acid. Later on at home, the parents are going out and hire an older woman to babysit him and his sister. One scene has the woman pouring milk for her kitten and puts a box over it as its drinking, but later when she lifts up the box, the kitten is gone. I think the boy appears holding and petting it before her. The boy is shown in either the front yard or backyard, setting up a light sensor system. The bully shows up later, now with a bandaged hand and crosses the sensor, alerting the boy. I think they end up in the garage when the boy shows up with a sword and spiked helmet. A piece of wood or cardboard falls when they scuffle and the bully tries to push it forward but the boy stabs the sword through, killing the bully. Don\u2019t remember how it starts, but the boy and the babysitter fights and he ends up throwing her kitten into the fire. When she\u2019s crying over it, he knocks her out (i think). As she\u2019s on the ground, he gloats and pours alcohol/wine on her face/head. She gets up and I think they fight a bit more and she pushes him. He falls on top of the spiked helmet from earlier and crawls away. The parents come home and she doesn\u2019t respond to them and gets her bike to leave, all the while they\u2019re yelling that she drank all the alcohol. A closeup of the boy\u2019s face is seen staring off into space and we realize he is dead. A hand reaches for his glasses and we see the little sister putting them on.

I think in that movie, there were strange crawling creatures, that looked like trilobites or giant isopods. They came from a strange aparatus which could have been a time machine, portal to another dimension or something like that. In one scene you could see a monster in this machine, that looked somewhat like the creature from \u201cnightbeast\u201d.

I never saw the entire movie, I actually walked in on my mom watching it in the middle of the night when I was a kid. Think it might have been around 2002 if I\u2019m remembering correctly, since we lived in a lot of different apartments and I think both this movie and seeing the MJ Blanket incident on the news happened in the same apartment. Rough estimate. Anyway I saw presumably the beginning of the movie. It took place in a pretty old time iirc, maybe in Italy just going off of the architecture and clothing the man was wearing and I think he might have been in some kind of really old-looking art studio. He opened this old box and pulled out this big ball, kind of like a crystal ball but completely opaque white (or maybe kind of marbled). Something happened with the ball and it kind of\u2026swallowed his arm? And started changing shape a bit when it did. I don\u2019t remember what happened before that moment or what happened immediately after, but he died (or maybe his friend, I think he had a friend) and these two women emerged from the ball or were awakened BY the ball, and they were covered in these really thin, see-through cloaks that looked like they were made of cobwebs. I think one of them was blonde, and then they left the \u201dstudio\u201d and started walking down the street, still only wearing the robes. Anyway I think it was turned off and I was put back to bed.

The movie was a British or Irish comedy that had come out sometime in the mid to late 1990s.  It was about a meek librarian who lived with a domineering mother, had  a bitch of a sister with a thuggish boyfriend and a lover she had to hide from her family.  She was fascinated by great serial killers of the past and eventually several famous ones start appearing to her.  They help guide her in first killing her mother, then her sister and then the sister\u2019s boyfriend.  She ends marrying her lover and sending her \u201cadvisors\u201d away because \u2013 as she points out \u2013 they were all caught and she doen\u2019t want to be. There are two scenes that I particular remember.  The first is after she kills her sister, which she does by doing something to her inhaler.  The sister\u2019s boyfriend decides that she killed her because she wanted him.  They are standing in the kitchen together and he tells her that she can have him if she wants him that badly.  I remember her smiling at him and putting her arms around him before stabbing him in the back with a pair of scissors. The second is the last sense.  She\u2019s on her honeymoon with the man she\u2019s been in love with the entire time and they are lying in bed together.  He has his eyes closed, getting ready to go to sleep and he says that btw he knows she killed her mother.  Something she said at the time didn\u2019t add up but that he understands why she did it and would never tell anyone.  She gets up out of bed after he\u2019s asleep and is trying to figure out to what to do.  She opens the door and there\u2019s a little man in a Victorian suit with a kind of doctor\u2019s bag there who smiles at her and introduces himself very politely as Jack the Ripper.  She smiles back at him and that\u2019s the end of the movie. It\u2019s a very dark comedy but also a very cleaver one that I really enjoyed.  I\u2019d really love to find it again.  There are aspects to the movie that remind me a little of \u2018Keeping Mum\u2019 if you know that movie.

Hi, I\u2019ve been trying to find a movie that I saw years ago. I have little information to go on, I can\u2019t remember any famous actors being it, but it was about a group of people all living their own lives. I think one the main people was crippled or walking with the aid of a stick. I can\u2019t excactly remember the details of the story but I remember some specific scenes. One in particular where a person (I think a woman, one of the main characters in the movie) is in a car on a bridge. And these strange ripples appear making the bridge disappear bit by bit and causing her to fall into the water. And then a few second later the bridge reappears again piece by piece. Then there is a scene where the main protagonists get together and find out where those ripples come from and apparently they come from somewhere in the middle of an ocean or sea. They try to go their on a boat before it is too late (they have limited time from what I can remember, before the next ripple comes) and then they arrive at this sort of facility in the middle of the sea and they go inside and find out tue government or military (I\u2019m not sure) is creating the ripples and the boss there explains everything. I\u2019m not sure what happens next but in the end they all are back at home and their lives are better.

There characters are very different \u2013 while perhaps incorrect, I am picturing Bernie Mac in traditional South African attire and Eddie Jemison as a Rabbi or something.

After a pause, Eddie responds perfectly in the South African language and suprises everyone. They both make it through the security line safely.
