This movie I saw approximately 3 years ago(2012) It was an English, color movie that described the life of a younger girl who taken from her home as a young girl. When she is older, she is forced to dance in a gentleman\u2019s club. When she is chosen to do private dances, she closes her eyes and imagines a separate world. These worlds are always exciting and actiony, and always have a goal that relates back to a larger plan for her and the other dancers to escape the club. Some of the worlds range from a snowy mountain-top where she is fighting ninjas and samurai, to worlds where it is war-torn and in flames. In the end, only one of the girls escapes(She is not the main character described above). As she boards a bus, the driver(Who appears in every world the Main Character thinks up) welcomes her and we hear a voice-over that says something like \u201cSometimes you find out that you are not the main character of your own story.

My only recollection of this movie that it was a high fantasy, sword & sorcery type movie that was on network television (I didn\u2019t have cable) during daylight hours.  All I remember is a man in a dark red cavern with a sword talking to what looked like a very large dragon or monster which made either a deep booming sound or actually talked to him.  The monster appeared to be several stories tall, and the scene took place toward the very end of the movie, because i remember it ended soon after.  I believe it was the climax of the movie.

I really do not know why he comes to this particular town, most likely he has info that another piece is located somewhere around the area. Also there are other people looking for the same artifacts and they are in a competition. The movie is pivoting around this search and confrontation between the groups. So it\u2019s mostly an action movie. I remember this scene at the very end of the film, this is how the movie ends. The protagonist and his opponent are fighting on the beach, the hero overcomes his enemy and a wave carries out the pieces of the artifact into the sea. The protagonist is walking sadly along the shore and suddenly finds both pieces thrown ashore by the wave. So he takes these two pieces and moves to some different location continuing his search. The end has this feel of the Incredible Hulk TV series. I remember asking my father about these metallic plates and their meaning.

My query is:\n\n Metallic Plates, Alien Artifact(?), Fight on the Beach The genre is sci-fi, action, adventure (but not that much of sci-fi actually). This movie was on TV in the early 80s, so most likely it\u2019s from the 70s. It was a very simple, moderate budget movie without any special effects. It was in color, I think. A young man comes to a provincial seashore town having in his possession a piece of a metallic plate, decorated with strange symbols. As far as I recall they look like Phoenician alphabet. However, this is just a small piece of a bigger artifact, so this guy is looking for the rest of it. I really do not know why he comes to this particular town, most likely he has info that another piece is located somewhere around the area. Also there are other people looking for the same artifacts and they are in a competition. The movie is pivoting around this search and confrontation between the groups. So it\u2019s mostly an action movie. I remember this scene at the very end of the film, this is how the movie ends. The protagonist and his opponent are fighting on the beach, the hero overcomes his enemy and a wave carries out the pieces of the artifact into the sea. The protagonist is walking sadly along the shore and suddenly finds both pieces thrown ashore by the wave. So he takes these two pieces and moves to some different location continuing his search. The end has this feel of the Incredible Hulk TV series. I remember asking my father about these metallic plates and their meaning. He said something like: These were parts of an artifact left by extraterrestrials who visited Earth in ancient times, the text on the plates revealed the date of their return. However, I\u2019m not sure whether he was joking or not.", "request_prompt": "3", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7sQpqxl2lYabpGiLq35ICWRdRBKrZ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1693207222, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on your description, the key details for your query are:\n\n- Movie genre: sci-fi, action, adventure (but not heavily sci-fi)\n- TV movie from the early 80s, likely from the 70s\n- Simple, moderate budget movie without special effects\n- Color movie\n- Young man comes to a provincial seashore town with a piece of a metallic plate with strange symbols (possibly Phoenician alphabet)\n- He is searching for the rest of the artifact\n- Other people are also looking for the artifacts, creating competition\n- Movie focuses on the search and confrontation between the groups\n- Ends with a fight on the beach between the protagonist and his opponent\n- The hero wins, but the waves carry the artifact pieces into the sea\n- The protagonist finds both pieces washed ashore and continues his search\n\nI will now conduct a search with these key details to provide you with relevant results."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 617}}}, "French Movie 60s?
