This movie I saw approximately 3 years ago(2012) It was an English, color movie that described the life of a younger girl who taken from her home as a young girl. When she is older, she is forced to dance in a gentleman\u2019s club. When she is chosen to do private dances, she closes her eyes and imagines a separate world. These worlds are always exciting and actiony, and always have a goal that relates back to a larger plan for her and the other dancers to escape the club. Some of the worlds range from a snowy mountain-top where she is fighting ninjas and samurai, to worlds where it is war-torn and in flames. In the end, only one of the girls escapes(She is not the main character described above). As she boards a bus, the driver(Who appears in every world the Main Character thinks up) welcomes her and we hear a voice-over that says something like \u201cSometimes you find out that you are not the main character of your own story.
