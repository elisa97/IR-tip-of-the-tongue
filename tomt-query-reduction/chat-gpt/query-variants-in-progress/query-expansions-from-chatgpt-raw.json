At some point, he throws the pancake and it disappears. Then both man and girl lift their eyes and see that the pancake is stuck to the ceiling. Several years ago, I\u2019ve been told that this film is, perhaps, \u201cThe Paper Moon\u201d by \u201cPeter Bogdanovich\u2026 However, I rewatched it a few years back and never saw such a scene.

The movie starts out with an American family who are staying in some East European Castle with their young son. He\u2019s like maybe 9 or 10. I think it was in Czechoslovakia, maybe Romania. It\u2019s night time and the boy is running around trying to escape some thing that is chasing him throughout the castle and you can hear his parents screaming. He manages to escape the castle, but his parents are killed by whatever was chasing him. Years later he comes back with his girlfriend or fiancee and their going to stay at the same castle. Little by little, his behavior becomes eratic as he is slowly being possessed by whatever force lives in the castle. Eventually, he starts chasing his girl and is trying to kill her. She eventually makes it down to some hidden area where the mummified remains of some prince is sitting on a throne. Suddenly, the prince gets up and starts shambling towards her. He\u2019s moving really slow since it\u2019s all practical effects. Turns out he\u2019s the one who has been possessing the guy. The prince was young when he died, I think, and wanted the kid to stay with him. That\u2019s why he got rid of the guys parents. So, she\u2019s being chased by both of them. In the end, she manages to get away and I think she ends up killing her boyfriend in order to escape. Then, the prince sits back on his throne and whispers \u201cStay,\u201d over and over before it fades to black and the credits roll. Hopefully, someone here has seen it. I honestly think I only saw it the one time, but that mummy prince starting to move freaked me out when I saw it as a kid!", "request_prompt": "4", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7sUiDbwLD4qjObKmkfLOTWvSPteT3", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1693222125, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Late 80's or early 90's horror film set in an East European castle.

This scene has stuck with me for years and I have never been able to figure out where it\u2019s from. I think it\u2019s from a movie, but it\u2019s possible it was a t.v. show. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s from the 80s. This is what I remember: There is a door (I remember it being white and maybe with red markings on it but that could be wrong) on the side of a highway or road. No one is supposed to go through the door. Two teens are missing and it looks like they went through the door, I think I remember cops being outside the door and maybe an upset parent. No one on the search team goes too far into the cave system behind the door. Later, other teens want to try and find them and I think there was something about using a rope tied to the entrance to ensure they would find their way back. I think the premise was that whoever went through the door would be lost forever. Any ideas?

I remember someone telling me Psycho Kids was on but they had said Psychic Kids (a TV show). I heard them wrong. I had gotten them confused a couple times. I Google the name and nothing comes up. Plot: A family moved into a new house by the woods. It was winter. Strange things were happening and there were kid ghosts (they appeared in human form) in the woods. In one scene, the oldest daughter is on her knees on a hill. She was looking for one or two of her siblings. In another, the \u201cpsycho kids\u201d (ghost kids) were beating down the car to get to the family. I remember a boy having an axe. The kids had really weird black eyes. And their clothes seemed to be from the 1920\u2019s. It was in color and English. It was on some type of on demand TV service. That\u2019s why i was able to watch it so many times.
