The woman is there to catch / kill / recapture the alien. The guy helps her throughout the movie. There are several chasing scenes where people try to get away before being infected by the parasite like alien. I remember a scene that points out that coffee is something the woman has never had. And late in the movie I remember that a creature is captured inside a sealed room in spaceship / station. Not sure if its \u201cthe mother\u201d and if it escapes. There is a scene where a heavy door that should be closed opens up. I\u2019ve been trying to find this movie for almost 25 years, still remembering all these details. Never found it. Friends say it must be the famous Alien movie, but i don\u2019t think so. I watched it when i was ~9 years old, with my 6 years older nephew. He told me back then that the movie was called Monsters, but that was probably loosely translated. It could well be that my memory is not completely accurate, but most of what i described i can clearly visualize. Would be great if someone recognizes this movie!

One of the other members is a bit of a wimp (from memory). The wimpy guy takes/borrows one of these knives and I think he must throw it or something, anyway something happens and the tip of the knife sticks into his forearm. When the tough guy tries to pull the knife out, the tip breaks off and starts to travel up the wimpy guys arm. He decides to cut his arm off to save his life. That\u2019s all I can remember.

The scene goes like this:  A young girl and a young boy (both 12-16, I\u2019d guess), both half-dressed, seemingly a bit shy and totally clueless about sex, try to have either sex or perform a handjob on the boy. They stand in a simply furnished room with (IIRC) not much more than a bed, a chair and maybe a table.   They alternately make suggestions (more like guesses) how to go about it. When the boy makes a suggestion, he repeatedly refers to horses (\u201clike I\u2019ve seen horses do\u201d, something along those lines).   One of the suggestions is that the girl should stand on a chair.   At one point, the girl tells the boy to stop making references to horses.   At one point, the girl removes her bra (no nudity is shown, thanks to the camera perspective / clipping).   At the end of the scene, the girl is seen having her hands near/in the boy\u2019s genital area and remarking something like \u201coh, only so little (liquid)?\u201d.

The movie was a British or Irish comedy that had come out sometime in the mid to late 1990s.  It was about a meek librarian who lived with a domineering mother, had  a bitch of a sister with a thuggish boyfriend and a lover she had to hide from her family.  She was fascinated by great serial killers of the past and eventually several famous ones start appearing to her.  They help guide her in first killing her mother, then her sister and then the sister\u2019s boyfriend.  She ends marrying her lover and sending her \u201cadvisors\u201d away because \u2013 as she points out \u2013 they were all caught and she doen\u2019t want to be. There are two scenes that I particular remember.  The first is after she kills her sister, which she does by doing something to her inhaler.  The sister\u2019s boyfriend decides that she killed her because she wanted him.  They are standing in the kitchen together and he tells her that she can have him if she wants him that badly.  I remember her smiling at him and putting her arms around him before stabbing him in the back with a pair of scissors. The second is the last sense.  She\u2019s on her honeymoon with the man she\u2019s been in love with the entire time and they are lying in bed together.  He has his eyes closed, getting ready to go to sleep and he says that btw he knows she killed her mother.  Something she said at the time didn\u2019t add up but that he understands why she did it and would never tell anyone.  She gets up out of bed after he\u2019s asleep and is trying to figure out to what to do.  She opens the door and there\u2019s a little man in a Victorian suit with a kind of doctor\u2019s bag there who smiles at her and introduces himself very politely as Jack the Ripper.  She smiles back at him and that\u2019s the end of the movie. It\u2019s a very dark comedy but also a very cleaver one that I really enjoyed.  I\u2019d really love to find it again.  There are aspects to the movie that remind me a little of \u2018Keeping Mum\u2019 if you know that movie.  However, while the acting in the film is brilliant I don\u2019t remember seeing any of the actors in it before or since.

The movie was a British or Irish comedy that had come out sometime in the mid to late 1990s.  It was about a meek librarian who lived with a domineering mother, had  a bitch of a sister with a thuggish boyfriend and a lover she had to hide from her family.  She was fascinated by great serial killers of the past and eventually several famous ones start appearing to her.  They help guide her in first killing her mother, then her sister and then the sister\u2019s boyfriend.  She ends marrying her lover and sending her \u201cadvisors\u201d away because \u2013 as she points out \u2013 they were all caught and she doen\u2019t want to be. There are two scenes that I particular remember.  The first is after she kills her sister, which she does by doing something to her inhaler.  The sister\u2019s boyfriend decides that she killed her because she wanted him.  They are standing in the kitchen together and he tells her that she can have him if she wants him that badly.  I remember her smiling at him and putting her arms around him before stabbing him in the back with a pair of scissors. The second is the last sense.  She\u2019s on her honeymoon with the man she\u2019s been in love with the entire time and they are lying in bed together.  He has his eyes closed, getting ready to go to sleep and he says that btw he knows she killed her mother.  Something she said at the time didn\u2019t add up but that he understands why she did it and would never tell anyone.  She gets up out of bed after he\u2019s asleep and is trying to figure out to what to do.  She opens the door and there\u2019s a little man in a Victorian suit with a kind of doctor\u2019s bag there who smiles at her and introduces himself very politely as Jack the Ripper.  She smiles back at him and that\u2019s the end of the movie. It\u2019s a very dark comedy but also a very cleaver one that I really enjoyed.  I\u2019d really love to find it again.
