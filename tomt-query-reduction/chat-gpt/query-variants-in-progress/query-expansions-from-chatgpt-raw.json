I remember the climax of the movie being like two grown men (possibly a Dad and a teacher \u2013 or they could\u2019ve been next door neighbours) fighting in a school gym at night, and they end up on some kind of rock face/waterfall and someone falls, but no one dies! The following scene shows the family leaving the neighbourhood and the teacher/neighbour covered in plaster casts. I saw this movie on Sky Movies in the early 00s, I think I remember it being shown a lot. It was probably made in the late 90s. It was an American family movie. I\u2019m pretty sure it started with the family moving into the neighbourhood with a pretty full car. And if I remember rightly, the Dad was quite a weighty/hefty dude. Sorry I haven\u2019t included much detail but this is all I can remember! Hopefully the fight scene will ring some bells with somebody.

We would fall asleep watching the TV. Usually I was the last one to fall asleep and so could watch part of a horror movie until commercials came on and I fell asleep from boredom and the TV would run until morning, or I woke up later and caught the ending and turned off the TV. Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can\u2019t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook\u2026 maybe\u2026 The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn\u2019t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can\u2019t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here\u2019s some conversation they had: Daughter: \u201cWe\u2019ve been passing by that cabin all night\u201d Father: \u201cThis is a military road, all the cabins look the same\u201d *some arguing and desperation* Father: \u201cIf we keep driving we should be OK\u201d *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending\u2026 The father somehow disappeared, can\u2019t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can\u2019t remember.

She is a regular height woman, also Caucasian, slim and with red hair. In the last scene of the movie, they are dancing on a balcony or rooftop and she is wearing a white dress. Maybe it\u2019s their wedding? I have been through the filmographies of all the male Caucasian little people actors I can think of with no luck. My Googlefu has failed me as well.

It was in color, in English, and may have been on one of the kids channels. The main characters are a sister and her younger brother, a family friend who is like a big silent bouncer or bodyguard, and a young suave guy they meet. It\u2019s an adventure-fantasy in some sort of future dystopia. I remember a couple of scenes\u2026 Suave guy sees the sister fight off some military types and invites her to escape with him through a security checkpoint in the desert by racing their flying boards past the guards. They succeed in escaping, and are later joined by the brother and bodyguard dude, much to the chagrin of suave guy, who thought he was ditching the weaker elements. Sister says she would never leave them, they\u2019re her family. Later, the sister gets captured and taken to some sort of facility where she gets strapped to a gurney. She gets out of the straps by shimmying the gurney until the bottom release button is hit, then stretches her legs over her head to hit the top button. She wanders around the facility, running into the brother of a friend that is so doped up he doesn\u2019t even know who he is. She is recaptured, and suave guy and co. break in to save her.

It was in color, in English, and may have been on one of the kids channels. The main characters are a sister and her younger brother, a family friend who is like a big silent bouncer or bodyguard, and a young suave guy they meet. It\u2019s an adventure-fantasy in some sort of future dystopia. I remember a couple of scenes\u2026 Suave guy sees the sister fight off some military types and invites her to escape with him through a security checkpoint in the desert by racing their flying boards past the guards. They succeed in escaping, and are later joined by the brother and bodyguard dude, much to the chagrin of suave guy, who thought he was ditching the weaker elements. Sister says she would never leave them, they\u2019re her family. Later, the sister gets captured and taken to some sort of facility where she gets strapped to a gurney. She gets out of the straps by shimmying the gurney until the bottom release button is hit, then stretches her legs over her head to hit the top button. She wanders around the facility, running into the brother of a friend that is so doped up he doesn\u2019t even know who he is. She is recaptured, and suave guy and co. break in to save her. The group have almost made it to safety when their way is blocked and bodyguard dude has to sacrifice himself to ensure their escape. The final scene shows the kids running around a beach playing and enjoying their new-found freedom while suave guy does a voiceover.

A boy walks into a room and notices someone sleeping (or dead) and takes an item from them and walks out. He\u2019s shown to be the stereotypical nerd with glasses and a tucked in, button up shirt. There were scenes of him putting on headphones and tinkering around with what seemed to be a giant computer or radio system. In one class, a bully teases him and he makes a mixture in a beaker and pours it on the bully\u2019s arm. Turns out it was acid. Later on at home, the parents are going out and hire an older woman to babysit him and his sister. One scene has the woman pouring milk for her kitten and puts a box over it as its drinking, but later when she lifts up the box, the kitten is gone. I think the boy appears holding and petting it before her. The boy is shown in either the front yard or backyard, setting up a light sensor system. The bully shows up later, now with a bandaged hand and crosses the sensor, alerting the boy. I think they end up in the garage when the boy shows up with a sword and spiked helmet. A piece of wood or cardboard falls when they scuffle and the bully tries to push it forward but the boy stabs the sword through, killing the bully. Don\u2019t remember how it starts, but the boy and the babysitter fights and he ends up throwing her kitten into the fire. When she\u2019s crying over it, he knocks her out (i think). As she\u2019s on the ground, he gloats and pours alcohol/wine on her face/head. She gets up and I think they fight a bit more and she pushes him. He falls on top of the spiked helmet from earlier and crawls away. The parents come home and she doesn\u2019t respond to them and gets her bike to leave, all the while they\u2019re yelling that she drank all the alcohol. A closeup of the boy\u2019s face is seen staring off into space and we realize he is dead. A hand reaches for his glasses and we see the little sister putting them on.

There were scenes of him putting on headphones and tinkering around with what seemed to be a giant computer or radio system. In one class, a bully teases him and he makes a mixture in a beaker and pours it on the bully\u2019s arm. Turns out it was acid. Later on at home, the parents are going out and hire an older woman to babysit him and his sister. One scene has the woman pouring milk for her kitten and puts a box over it as its drinking, but later when she lifts up the box, the kitten is gone. I think the boy appears holding and petting it before her. The boy is shown in either the front yard or backyard, setting up a light sensor system. The bully shows up later, now with a bandaged hand and crosses the sensor, alerting the boy. I think they end up in the garage when the boy shows up with a sword and spiked helmet. A piece of wood or cardboard falls when they scuffle and the bully tries to push it forward but the boy stabs the sword through, killing the bully. Don\u2019t remember how it starts, but the boy and the babysitter fights and he ends up throwing her kitten into the fire. When she\u2019s crying over it, he knocks her out (i think). As she\u2019s on the ground, he gloats and pours alcohol/wine on her face/head. She gets up and I think they fight a bit more and she pushes him. He falls on top of the spiked helmet from earlier and crawls away. The parents come home and she doesn\u2019t respond to them and gets her bike to leave, all the while they\u2019re yelling that she drank all the alcohol. A closeup of the boy\u2019s face is seen staring off into space and we realize he is dead. A hand reaches for his glasses and we see the little sister putting them on. She sits herself down in front of the computer/radio and puts on headphones as the scene freezes and fades out.", "request_prompt": "2", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7sOaR7U87uRTnYqbkQ8a5BgvQ0GCi", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1693198579, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Horror/Slasher Babysitter movie 80s: Boy nerd with glasses kills bully and babysitter, acid pour, sensor system, sword, spiked helmet, kitten thrown into fire, alcohol poured on babysitter's face, boy dies, little sister takes over."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 570, "completion_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 625}}}, "Old Scary movie I remember this old B movie I watched about 35-40 years ago.

I even watched it online so it\u2019s impossible for me to track down\u2026 Anyway, it was definitely a Chinese film taking place in a more historical setting with emperors, generals, war, you know the ususal. The story focused on the relationship between two men. I believe one of the men was of a higher/royal power and the other had some kind of position in their army ??? I\u2019m not quite sure. Either way, they were lovers. At some point everyone kept nagging the higher power (let\u2019s just call him the king) to have an heir, but he was repulsed by sleeping with a woman. So, for some reason he told his lover to sleep with his wife so that she can become pregnant. The lover goes through with it and some time afterwards realizes that he actually enjoyed being with the opposite sex. It gets a bit fuzzy from there, but I do remember the wife and the king\u2019s lover are caught \u201cin the act\u201d inside a storage room or something. The king is so offended that he throws him in prison or castrates him; something like that.

I even watched it online so it\u2019s impossible for me to track down\u2026 Anyway, it was definitely a Chinese film taking place in a more historical setting with emperors, generals, war, you know the ususal. The story focused on the relationship between two men. I believe one of the men was of a higher/royal power and the other had some kind of position in their army ??? I\u2019m not quite sure. Either way, they were lovers. At some point everyone kept nagging the higher power (let\u2019s just call him the king) to have an heir, but he was repulsed by sleeping with a woman. So, for some reason he told his lover to sleep with his wife so that she can become pregnant. The lover goes through with it and some time afterwards realizes that he actually enjoyed being with the opposite sex. It gets a bit fuzzy from there, but I do remember the wife and the king\u2019s lover are caught \u201cin the act\u201d inside a storage room or something. The king is so offended that he throws him in prison or castrates him; something like that.

It was winter if I remember correctly, the man reminds me of nicolas cage don\u2019t know why, his wife is a blonde girl, her real name is sounds something like polish/czech, and they had kids, or 1 girl, can\u2019t remember exactly. He was living his life like that until some cop break into the house and finds him afterwards, he sees that he is dreaming and stuff like that, and the wife and the girl dissappears and there ends the movie. This movie left me in tears and gave me some kind of feeling that I never felt before. If someone, anyone knows something let me know please!

It was in color, and english, I think it was set in New York , or a city. I don\u2019t remember the plot very much, just mainly that it was about a woman. I mostly recall the beginning because it really caught me off guard. A woman (I believe the one the movie is about) was giving birth, and they actually showed the baby coming out. It wasn\u2019t fake at all, I\u2019m pretty sure it was an actual birth. They cut it together with the actresses face and it looked like she was really giving birth. Maybe that\u2019s too progressive for the 70\u2019s? I\u2019m not sure\u2026I saw the film in the early 2000\u2019s at some point, so maybe it was never an just looked old?
