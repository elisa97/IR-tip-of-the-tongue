Two Grown Men Fighting At Night In Gym/Waterfall So the detail I have for this movie is limited, so I apologise. Also it\u2019s a little all over the place. I remember the climax of the movie being like two grown men (possibly a Dad and a teacher \u2013 or they could\u2019ve been next door neighbours) fighting in a school gym at night, and they end up on some kind of rock face/waterfall and someone falls, but no one dies! The following scene shows the family leaving the neighbourhood and the teacher/neighbour covered in plaster casts. I saw this movie on Sky Movies in the early 00s, I think I remember it being shown a lot. It was probably made in the late 90s. It was an American family movie. I\u2019m pretty sure it started with the family moving into the neighbourhood with a pretty full car. And if I remember rightly, the Dad was quite a weighty/hefty dude. Sorry I haven\u2019t included much detail but this is all I can remember! Hopefully the fight scene will ring some bells with somebody.

We would fall asleep watching the TV. Usually I was the last one to fall asleep and so could watch part of a horror movie until commercials came on and I fell asleep from boredom and the TV would run until morning, or I woke up later and caught the ending and turned off the TV. Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can\u2019t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook\u2026 maybe\u2026 The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn\u2019t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can\u2019t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here\u2019s some conversation they had: Daughter: \u201cWe\u2019ve been passing by that cabin all night\u201d Father: \u201cThis is a military road, all the cabins look the same\u201d *some arguing and desperation* Father: \u201cIf we keep driving we should be OK\u201d *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending\u2026 The father somehow disappeared, can\u2019t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can\u2019t remember.

I think part of the plot is that he might have trouble making friends because some people are prejudiced against his size. Sometimes he abuses alcohol because of this. He re-connects with a woman he knew when he was a child, even though she used to tease him back when they were children. They become friends and eventually fall in love. She is a regular height woman, also Caucasian, slim and with red hair. In the last scene of the movie, they are dancing on a balcony or rooftop and she is wearing a white dress. Maybe it\u2019s their wedding? I have been through the filmographies of all the male Caucasian little people actors I can think of with no luck. My Googlefu has failed me as well.
