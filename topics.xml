    <title>claymation kids show with british narrator dog kid penguin in white void</title>
    <description>Nick Jr. claymation show? I have one vague memory of a claymation kid’s show. It had a dog character, possibly a kid character(unsure), and a British narrator. I think it also had a penguin character that had a hat that did some crazy things. Also I think the show always took place in a white void. Don’t get it twisted though, I’m not thinking of that claymation penguin “noot noot” show.</description>
