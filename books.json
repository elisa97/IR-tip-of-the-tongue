I can remember a lot about the novel but haven't had any luck with google, amazon, or other means.\n\nThe title had something to do with Ravens, I'm sure.  It might also have had the words 'wing,' 'wind,' or 'flight.'  On Raven Wings, or Flight of the Raven or something.\n\nStarting with the cover:  It was a illustration of a man\/boy in a black cloak walking toward the viewer down a path, I think holding a staff.\n\nThe novel starts out with the main character on an island with a lot of other boys.  I think the name had something to do with opals, although I don't remember if that was what they were gathering on the island.  It was very competitive between the boys.  Quite a bit of fighting, if I recall correctly.  They all wanted to gain the favor of the father\/owner who was a man.  He would take the best\/winner off the island to help sell their wares in a main town.  Eventually the main character escaped.\n\nLater in the novel he is captured (or at least the place he is staying at is raided by) a group of barbarian-type people who where greatly feared by the townspeople.  They had something to do with wolves, but I'm not sure if by name or they wore wolf skins.  He became a slave again, but was a very hard worker (and I think earned their respect because he was tough).\n\nIn another part he stops at an old woman's house which is a ways out from a town.  She is crazy, but is the watcher for the town and gives warning if a particular faction comes to sack the town.  We find out how crazy she was when she pulls out a container from under her bed with her babies, which were long dead.\n\nnear the end of the novel, he competes in a tournament where the winner gets to marry a princess, or some other daughter of a noble.  In the second to last chapter, right after he wins,  **[Spoilers]**, he is stabbed in the back and killed because another competitor and the  princess where in love.  The last chapter is from either the Main Character's friend's perspective, or the person who killed him.\n\nThe whole story was in a sort of medieval setting, and I'm pretty sure there was no magic, but I could be wrong.  It was very much an adventure story.  I read it about 11 years ago, if that helps.  Hopefully you guys have enough detail to help as this has been haunting me for about a year.","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_2as25p","gilded":0.0,"archived":1.0,"id":"2as25p","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"abiding_duderino","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":1405448970.0,"secure_media":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/2as25p\/tomtbook_fantasy_novel_where_boy_starts_on_island\/","score":1,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_2as25p","author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"dontbelurkingatme","controversiality":0,"id":"ciyrsoq","edited":false,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","link_id":"t3_2as25p","downs":0,"archived":true,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","removal_reason":null,"score_hidden":false,"created_utc":"1405488586","distinguished":null,"ups":3,"score":3,"gilded":0,"name":"t1_ciyrsoq","body":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/topic\/show\/992292-old-book-involving-slave-boys-and-a-girl-named-beryl-s","retrieved_on":1434738756,"comments":[{"retrieved_on":1434745914,"score_hidden":false,"id":"ciz5pd3","removal_reason":null,"created_utc":"1405531516","body":"Perfect!

I believe there was a multiverse angle, and either the main world was Earth and wasn't supposed to have any magic, or the main world had the magic Earth was supposed to have. Not sure about that.  Whatever the case, it's eventually fixed, and the main specific thing I remember is that as a result of this one of the characters, who was some sort of magical prodigy, is instead a chess prodigy in the new world where the extra magic was fixed. I don't think this was a particularly major plot point, but for whatever reason it's what lodged in my brain. This is probably from a young adult novel or series, and I probably read it 5-10 years ago although I couldn't tell you when it was actually published.","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_5gyxq2","gilded":0.0,"archived":0.0,"id":"5gyxq2","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"science-i","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/5gyxq2\/tomtbookmagical_prodigy_becomes_nonmagical_chess\/","score":2,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"controversiality":0,"author":"ceefrock","id":"daw7ng5","score":2,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","parent_id":"t3_5gyxq2","retrieved_on":1483542410,"author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"link_id":"t3_5gyxq2","stickied":false,"body":"Witch Week by Diana Wynne Jones?

I recall during the time that I read it, that I felt that the book was somewhat of an obscure one, and possibly not well-known, but I could've been wrong. :\/\nThe book was a paperback children's novel. I recall that it had a yellow cover, and that on the front cover was an illustration (possibly a painting or pastel illustration?) of a boy with a baseball cap (and possibly blonde hair) and a girl with straight brown hair looking up at a missing person's poster stuck to either a telephone pole or a fence. The missing poster showed a picture of a girl with long curly\/wavy (possibly red or blonde) hair (although I also recall the missing poster having been black-and-white, so I may have just assumed the missing girl's hair colour by the shades used :\/).\n\n \n  The story was told in third person (I can't recall whether it was third person limited or third person omniscient); and the novel's main characters were two friends: a boy and a girl. The girl is a bit of a dreamer and is eager to go on adventures; whereas the boy is has more of a logical mindset and is more skeptical of things. \n\n  \n  The story starts off with them one day happening across some lost and found posters put up in their neighbourhood. They rhyme some of them off, including one for a lost pet (either a dog or a cat). The girl suggests looking for the lost pet; but the boy discourages her, noting the date that the pet had gone missing a few months ago, and said something along the lines of that the lost pet was likely in dog or cat heaven now. The girl then notices a poster for a missing teenage girl (I think that her name was Kelly, or something like that, but I could be wrong). The girl suggests that they try and find the missing girl; which the boy dismisses this at first, saying that his friend is crazy to think that they, being children, would be able to find a missing person (or something along the lines of that). However, the girl convinces him, and he reluctantly goes along with the plan. \n\n  \n  The pair end up going on a suspenseful quest to find the missing girl, with many dead ends; when they finally find her working at a pizzeria (or some type of restaurant). It turns out that she had secretly run away with her boyfriend. She refuses to return home, telling the two kids to keep her secret, saying that she hates her parents and that she likes her new job, saying that it pays well. The two kids can't understand why the \"missing\" girl doesn't want to return home, as they had previously met with her parents, who seemed to care about her (although, if I remember correctly, they were strict, or had a funny way of showing their feelings).\n\n  \n  I forget how the story ends :\/; but, IIRC, the kids keep the teenage girl's secret and the runaway teen returns home to her family on her own accord.\n\n  \n  Does anyone else remember a book like this one; or possibly know the title? Any input would be greatly appreciated! :)\n\n\n  Thank you for reading! :)","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_3dzaxt","gilded":0.0,"archived":0.0,"id":"3dzaxt","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"AquaSeerPerspectiva","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":1437423428.0,"secure_media":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/3dzaxt\/tomt_book_2nd_attempt_childrens_novel_about_kids\/","score":3,"edited":1437434838,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"archived":false,"edited":false,"downs":0,"parent_id":"t3_3dzaxt","subreddit":"tipofmytongue","removal_reason":null,"id":"cta9w6w","author":"sarded","score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1438040001,"score":2,"gilded":0,"ups":2,"body":"People might be able to understand your post better if you used paragraphs.  \nPut two spaces at the end of a paragraph to make newlines.","author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_cta9w6w","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":"1437434487","link_id":"t3_3dzaxt","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","comments":[{"link_id":"t3_3dzaxt","created_utc":"1437434676","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_ctaa04z","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","parent_id":"t1_cta9w6w","downs":0,"edited":1437434860,"archived":false,"body":"Oops! :( I can't believe that I forgot to do that! \n\nThank you for pointing this out! :) I'll edit it and make paragraphs!","retrieved_on":1438040094,"score":1,"gilded":0,"ups":1,"score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","removal_reason":null,"author":"AquaSeerPerspectiva","id":"ctaa04z","comments":[]}]},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","link_id":"t3_3dzaxt","created_utc":"1437434753","name":"t1_ctaa1pe","author_flair_css_class":null,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"Do you remember any of the character's names?

I rented it from my school's library back in 2001.\n\nThe book follows a child that is being trained by the military (typical I know) to basically strategically place individual solders on a virtual battlefield. They're using him\/other children like himself due to their great motor skills compared to old slow clumsy adults, or it night be because these kids are slightly genetically modified, I forget :\/ . He would reach down and almost touch a hologram soldier with impossible closeness (like a hundredth of an inch) and move them with such precision and speed it was nearly inhuman. He would have to exercise, I remember him having to do treadmill running with the respiration reading mask on and then retire to his room. Later a girl military child is introduced and she is animated and energetic compared to the first boy's closed off and calculating personality. Naturally he falls for her and I think she helps him sneak out of his room after hours to explore\\hangout even though it's against rules.\n\nThis is where things get really fuzzy for me. When a war actually starts and the boy is told that he'll be moving real soldiers with the hologram board he is super nervous and makes a few mistakes resulting in actually touching a few soldiers and killing them, or somehow through the story he's been slowly losing his gift at the board because he's changing from a closed off calculating person to someone with emotion and it's throwing him off his game. Lastely, I forget how it ends haha. I also forget if they're fighting other humans, other humans also with super kids, or some super fast reactioned aliens. Sorry I know this isn't a lot to go off of. \n\nI know this sounds A LOT like Ender's Game, but I can confirm that it wasn't that book.

She goes on to do her thesis on the effects of surfactants on freshwater ecosystems.\n\nOther things that happened in the book:\n\n- Early on, the narrator's parents are both killed in a car accident, leaving the kids to fend for themselves in a really small farming town\n\n- The narrator's older brother takes care of them in a kind of makeshift parent role, and gets a job working at the local general store, until the owners' daughter starts making advances on him. She entices him to touch her, then gets upset when he rejects her advances because he's afraid of getting her pregnant and still needs to look after the younger siblings; then he loses the job because she tells her parents something.\n\n- There's a family on a nearby farm with several generations of really awful fathers, culminating in one of them killing a son who doesn't want to take the abuse any more. The body is found in a sack submerged in a pond\/pothole and the father shoots himself before the RCMP can take him in.\n\n- I think the small town was in northern Ontario, Canada.","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_21ncrw","gilded":0.0,"archived":1.0,"id":"21ncrw","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"thetrivialstuff","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":1396067873.0,"secure_media":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/21ncrw\/tomt_book_fictionalized_autobiography_of_girl\/","score":2,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"archived":true,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","downs":0,"name":"t1_cger67b","author":"2OQuestions","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1433117676,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","author_flair_css_class":null,"parent_id":"t3_21ncrw","removal_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1396070895","body":"Try \/r\/whatsthatbook ","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cger67b","score":1,"score_hidden":false,"link_id":"t3_21ncrw","comments":[]},{"controversiality":0,"removal_reason":null,"edited":false,"created_utc":"1396106967","ups":1,"score":1,"distinguished":null,"archived":true,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1433120986,"name":"t1_cgey1vd","body":"I think it's [Crow Lake](http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/8646.Crow_Lake)!","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","link_id":"t3_21ncrw","score_hidden":false,"id":"cgey1vd","gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_21ncrw","author":"wedge_squadron","downs":0,"comments":[{"archived":true,"author":"thetrivialstuff","author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","gilded":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","link_id":"t3_21ncrw","edited":false,"distinguished":null,"id":"cgf8dzd","removal_reason":null,"ups":1,"parent_id":"t1_cgey1vd","score_hidden":false,"created_utc":"1396133748","controversiality":0,"name":"t1_cgf8dzd","author_flair_text":null,"body":"Pretty sure that's it, thanks!","downs":0,"score":1,"retrieved_on":1433125864,"comments":[]}]}],"banned_by":null,"selftext_html":null,"mod_reports":null,"report_reasons":null,"user_reports":null,"locked":null,"preview":null,"post_hint":null,"all_awardings":null,"allow_live_comments":null,"author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_richtext":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":null,"author_fullname":null,"author_patreon_flair":null,"author_premium":null,"can_gild":null,"category":"BOOK","content_categories":null,"contest_mode":null,"discussion_type":null,"gildings":null,"hidden":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":null,"is_crosspostable":null,"is_meta":null,"is_original_content":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":null,"is_robot_indexable":null,"is_video":null,"link_flair_background_color":null,"link_flair_richtext":null,"link_flair_template_id":null,"link_flair_text_color":null,"link_flair_type":null,"media_only":null,"no_follow":null,"num_crossposts":null,"parent_whitelist_status":null,"pinned":null,"pwls":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":null,"send_replies":null,"spoiler":null,"subreddit_subscribers":null,"subreddit_type":null,"suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":null,"treatment_tags":null,"upvote_ratio":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null,"crosspost_parent":null,"crosspost_parent_list":null,"url_overridden_by_dest":null,"can_mod_post":null,"removal_reason":null,"subreddit_name_prefixed":null,"author_cakeday":null,"awarders":null,"removed_by":null,"view_count":null,"call_to_action":null,"num_reports":null,"likes":null,"clicked":null,"approved_by":null,"brand_safe":null,"mod_note":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"approved_at_utc":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"rte_mode":null,"post_categories":null,"visited":null,"previous_visits":null}

Her dress changes colors with the seasons, and as her hair grows, her power grows, and the world celebrates everything becoming normal again.  The girl eventually finds that she is a stolen branch cut from a sort of tree of life and the girl heals this tree.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: more details from the first book:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gem is very important.  I think it makes the character some sort of king.  iirc they call it a beryl and it&amp;#39;s jade in color.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","mod_reports":[],"report_reasons":null,"user_reports":[],"locked":0.0,"preview":null,"post_hint":null,"all_awardings":null,"allow_live_comments":null,"author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":null,"author_patreon_flair":null,"author_premium":null,"can_gild":1.0,"category":"BOOK","content_categories":null,"contest_mode":0.0,"discussion_type":null,"gildings":null,"hidden":0.0,"is_created_from_ads_ui":null,"is_crosspostable":0.0,"is_meta":null,"is_original_content":0.0,"is_reddit_media_domain":0.0,"is_robot_indexable":null,"is_video":0.0,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Solved!"}],"link_flair_template_id":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"richtext","media_only":0.0,"no_follow":1.0,"num_crossposts":0.0,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","pinned":0.0,"pwls":6.0,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":null,"send_replies":1.0,"spoiler":0.0,"subreddit_subscribers":407044.0,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":null,"treatment_tags":null,"upvote_ratio":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6.0,"crosspost_parent":null,"crosspost_parent_list":null,"url_overridden_by_dest":null,"can_mod_post":null,"removal_reason":null,"subreddit_name_prefixed":null,"author_cakeday":null,"awarders":null,"removed_by":null,"view_count":null,"call_to_action":null,"num_reports":null,"likes":null,"clicked":0.0,"approved_by":null,"brand_safe":null,"mod_note":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"approved_at_utc":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"rte_mode":"markdown","post_categories":null,"visited":0.0,"previous_visits":null}

The evil elf has followed him and says something about how he will take our world's technology (which is their fantasy world) to take power.","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_57tyt8","gilded":0.0,"archived":0.0,"id":"57tyt8","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"109488","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/57tyt8\/tomtbook_an_terminal_ill_child_on_a_vacation_in\/","score":3,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"body":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Divide_trilogy","parent_id":"t3_57tyt8","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"d8uwdu6","author":"kmerecer","author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"score":4,"controversiality":0,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","link_id":"t3_57tyt8","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created_utc":1476656644,"retrieved_on":1478653191,"stickied":false,"comments":[{"body":"Thank you very much.","parent_id":"t1_d8uwdu6","author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author":"109488","edited":false,"distinguished":null,"id":"d8uwp42","score":2,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1476657071,"retrieved_on":1478653341,"stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","subreddit":"tipofmytongue","link_id":"t3_57tyt8","comments":[]}]}],"banned_by":null,"selftext_html":null,"mod_reports":null,"report_reasons":null,"user_reports":null,"locked":0.0,"preview":null,"post_hint":null,"all_awardings":null,"allow_live_comments":null,"author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_richtext":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":null,"author_fullname":null,"author_patreon_flair":null,"author_premium":null,"can_gild":null,"category":"BOOK","content_categories":null,"contest_mode":0.0,"discussion_type":null,"gildings":null,"hidden":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":null,"is_crosspostable":null,"is_meta":null,"is_original_content":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":null,"is_robot_indexable":null,"is_video":null,"link_flair_background_color":null,"link_flair_richtext":null,"link_flair_template_id":null,"link_flair_text_color":null,"link_flair_type":null,"media_only":null,"no_follow":null,"num_crossposts":null,"parent_whitelist_status":null,"pinned":null,"pwls":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":null,"send_replies":null,"spoiler":0.0,"subreddit_subscribers":null,"subreddit_type":null,"suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":null,"treatment_tags":null,"upvote_ratio":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null,"crosspost_parent":null,"crosspost_parent_list":null,"url_overridden_by_dest":null,"can_mod_post":null,"removal_reason":null,"subreddit_name_prefixed":null,"author_cakeday":null,"awarders":null,"removed_by":null,"view_count":null,"call_to_action":null,"num_reports":null,"likes":null,"clicked":null,"approved_by":null,"brand_safe":null,"mod_note":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"approved_at_utc":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"rte_mode":null,"post_categories":null,"visited":null,"previous_visits":null}

He explores archives, asks some queries to computers in the city and discovers old exit through tunnel with some odd machines. There he finds the way to the small village near the city, where the major is a woman.

There they explore some planets in the solar system with 5 (?) suns. There are no people, but boy somehow recalls that this system is supposed to be used as some kind of spaceship.

I (26yo) read it in high school but it wasn't new. \n\nSome details. \n\nThe front cover of book one shows a boy's face. It's mostly monochromatic blues and reds. The title is a year. I swear it had 9s in it. 3099. 2999. Etc. It was a series of maybe five or so books. This was junior YA, think animorphs in size and intensity. \n\nThe following is all the bits I remember about it. Spoilers of course. \n\nThere is a kid who is a good hacker. His hacking is represented by virtual \"dogs\" that he has made. the dogs attack computers aka hack stuff. \n\nTech is everywhere in this world. The main character has a wrist chip for money and tracking and when things get heavy he rips it out. Even school is done on the computer. \n\nThere is another boy who turns out to be a clone (twin?) of the first boy. HIS hacking representation is snakes that he sends and uses. \n\nI'm almost positive the first clone is on the moon or Mars where people live now. Not earth. I know the main boy goes there. \n\nThe main boy has a little sister. She gets a genetically engineered Pegasus for her birthday. It almost escapes and there is a scene where the main boy manages to catch it. \n\nThere is a plot twist of there being a third boy. One of them is evil. Shenanigans ensue and the fact that the boys are interchangeable visually is important. Maybe one of them pulls a parent trap like trick on someone. \n\nThe computer stuff and pacing was all cool and interesting. I would love to read these again and also make sure I didn't make them up. That would be nice too. \n\nThanks friends!","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_4arob0","gilded":0.0,"archived":0.0,"id":"4arob0","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"everdeer","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/4arob0\/tomt_book_junior_ya_series_about_hacker_clones\/","score":3,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"ups":1,"id":"d140z31","author":"everdeer","created_utc":1458264834,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"link_id":"t3_4arob0","retrieved_on":1460717537,"parent_id":"t3_4arob0","distinguished":null,"score":1,"stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"edited":false,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","body":"Solved!","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","author_flair_css_class":null,"comments":[]},{"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1458193997,"author":"teraflop","id":"d12z10q","score":3,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t3_4arob0","retrieved_on":1460699105,"link_id":"t3_4arob0","author_flair_css_class":null,"body":"Sounds like [Doomsday (2099) by John Peel.](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Doomsday-John-Peel\/dp\/0439060303)","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","subreddit":"tipofmytongue","stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"edited":false,"comments":[{"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"id":"d1411ti","created_utc":1458264961,"author":"everdeer","ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"body":"Thank you so much!

If I remember correctly the aliens left a probe in his brain and as the book goes on it starts talking to him more and more, telling him to go to the mothership and stuff I think.

I think this is going to be a super long shot, (ready tried this on \/r\/whatsthatbook, to no avail... yet) but, I read a great book several years ago and it's one of those books that just sorta sticks with you over the years. I find myself thinking of it every now and then. That doesn't happen often, I read a lot of books. \n\nKeep in mind it's been several long years (maybe 2009) since I read it and can't remember exactly what happened but this is the basic plot line: \nSet in Elizabethan (possibly Queen Mary's?) England. It was about a young girl who grew up in her father's modest manor, and their town was frequently raided by the scots. After one such raid, the girl finds an injured scot and nurses him back to health in secret. She finds a hermit to heal him I think (I remember maggots being involved in eating out rotten flesh). Then, they fall in love and it's this tragic problem where he needs to go home to scotland because no one will accept him in england (the scots and english hate each other) but she can't go with him because of her duty to her own family. SPOILER ALERT Near the end, the scot guy crashes a big feast at her fathers manor, steals a horse and gallops away with the girl, intending to take her back to scotland and she's all debating it, then last minute she declines, and he almost dies crossing some water with the horse to escape.\n\nGREAT BOOK.

There are two distinct \"worlds\" - one is the ground, where nonmagical people are suppressed with drugs and their lives harvested to power magic or magical devices. The other world is (as far as I can remember) a floating magical paradise-y utopia, where everyone uses and studies magic. There's some kind of magical gate that separates the two, that kills anyone who crosses from the crappy world into the good one.\n\nCharacter 1: this character is completely immune to magic, and neutralizes any magic he touches. He's from the crappy world. The story behind his escape: as a kid, he neutralizes the stuff in the food that keeps the lower humans sedated, neutralizes the stuff for another girl, and they both try to cross the gate.

There are other mainish-characters introduced, one scene I remember reading is one of the characters being ambushed by one or two full-geared knights and having to kill them with a dagger through the eyeholes. \n\nI know it's a long shot... thoughts?","media":null,"link_flair_css_class":"solvedcase","name":"t3_233puk","gilded":0.0,"archived":1.0,"id":"233puk","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":0.0,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"NYCtacos","stickied":0.0,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","created":1397582171.0,"secure_media":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tipofmytongue\/comments\/233puk\/tomtbook_fantasy_series\/","score":6,"edited":0,"quarantine":0.0,"comments":[{"author":"dorrdon","edited":false,"ups":2,"gilded":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","removal_reason":null,"id":"cgt516a","link_id":"t3_233puk","score":2,"retrieved_on":1433367214,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":"1397582236","controversiality":0,"archived":true,"score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_cgt516a","downs":0,"subreddit":"tipofmytongue","parent_id":"t3_233puk","author_flair_text":null,"body":"The Briar King? http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Briar_King","comments":[{"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1433367431,"score":1,"id":"cgt5hqk","link_id":"t3_233puk","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4oc","removal_reason":null,"ups":1,"gilded":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":false,"author":"NYCtacos","body":"YES.

It's noted that his final thoughts are for his daughter, and he prays that she did not feel fear as he does now at the time of her death. \n\n* One of the side characters happily tells everybody that he survived a shark attack by rubbing his urine on himself.\n\n* It ends with the guy saying he's unfamiliar with the mating rituals of mammals, and the girl saying he better learn fast. \n\n\n\nThanks to anybody who's read this and remembers!

However, there was the problem of plant-eating insects. So, the protagonist stole some milk from the communal kitchen and placed a bowl of them near her plants. The insects were found dead in the morning in the milk because they drank themselves to death and the plants were saved. \n\nAnother instance is, when stealing milk, she kept the jug of milk in her room's drawers. Once she forgot that the milk was there and it went bad. Her room-mates opened the drawer and found the jug of milk and everyone was told that our protagonist was a milk-stealer.\n\nThen there was a thing with a tennis match in which something was done by ruining the cookies provided for the teams and she was framed.

The problem is that *I* didn't read it.  It was a book for one of our 5th grade reading groups, and instead of reading the Hobbit in class like I was supposed to I would listen to the other reading group discuss this sci-fi book instead and read the Hobbit at home.\n\nI'm going to provide very sketchy details from 20 years ago but I'm sure someone knows of the book.  The books starred a few kids who were playing a game.

I remember a lot of details, but the general premise is so vague that it's not really that searchable. (Lots of media about post-nuclear fallout shelters...)\n\nIt was a decently thick book (200, 300 some pages?), cover was a blue sky and a green grassy field, possibly two figures standing in it. Not too much to say about the cover itself; it felt like one of those things you'd find in a bargain bin.\n\nThe book's about two kids, a girl who's grown up in a disaster shelter all her life, and another who is from the outside world and fell into the shelter by accident (maybe??). They're pretty young, towards the younger end of teenage and possibly younger.\n\nThe shelter's described as a gigantic skyscraper with lots of dirt packed around it, so much so that all you can see through the window is dirt. The girl's lived in the shelter all her life; she's been told that the outside world is a horrible place, but at the same time, the inside of the shelter is getting kind of run-down with age, and it's not so pleasant either. She's heard rumors that on the very top floor of the skyscraper is a gigantic glass dome with a whole bunch of artificial environments, from which the richest members of the shelter can look down on the world; the girl seeks to go to this dome.\n\nEventually she reaches the top of the tower and finds that the dome is actually ground-level, and the \"skyscraper\" is actually buried underground.

Someone decided to develop the land to build a suburb, but for some reason they either couldn't or wouldn't get rid of the old house, so they built the suburb around it. Every house was build in pieces, was perfectly identical, and in a perfect grid. But due to either an oversight or lack of funding, no road signs were ever added. So people learned where they lived relative to the old house (\"We're five streets north of it, six houses down\"). One day some bureaucrat decides the house is an eyesore and should be removed, so while everyone is at work\/school he gets rid of it (either demolishes it and removes all trace or just picks it up with a crane and sets it down far away). Then he puts in street signs everywhere. When people arrive home that afternoon, they have no idea where they live since every house is perfectly identical save for the odd tree or doghouse.

Also set in high school, I believe.\n* Upon first glance, the user assumes it's some sort of perfume. As they apply it to themselves, the author describes the scent as a strong odor of cinnamon. It is also described to have a slight burning sensation when applied.\n* The individual who catches a whiff of the smell...well...their behavior changes to the point where they fall madly in love with the person who applied the cinnamon spray. In fact, the lust they feel towards the individual is insatiable.\n* One of the male supporting characters dabs the cinnamon perfume on him, driving his close female friend to fall in love with him a little too much. During the burial of one of their friends, the female gets way too frisky with him. He's trying to get her to stop but somehow, he accidentally splashes it on her. Now that the male friend has caught scent of the perfume, he becomes ravenous and loses control.

Goes home, runs away ( I think ) and then later on in the book meets a spiritual companion of sorts who helps him realize that he needs to control his emotions otherwise he will keep having these outbreaks where he sets stuff on fire. Book goes on, he learns how to control his abilities and whatnot. Then Im kinda blank on the rest until the end where his one friend and love, his companion, is killed, and he like sets the world on fire or something.

The background is there was a kingdom that was prosperous because of the diamond mine that the king had. But one day something happened and someone else took over, someone evil.\n\nI believe princess was allowed to stay. She had a boy love, but the new person in charge didn't want her to be with him, so he faked the boy's death and sent him to the diamond mines. The diamond mines were a terrible place. Everyone mistreated him because he was the newbie. Additionally, he had to fight people in the \"diving bell\" they used (sort of like a big contraption that let them dive down and mine under the water). Eventually he somehow got free, and I don't remember what happened with the princess. Thank you!\n\nEdit for more details: I think at the end the boy confronts the dictator and has a sword duel with him. I also think that the boy's father think his son is dead the whole time.

I think she may have actually died later in the story. \n\nI don't remember too much about the plot, but I think it may have been a generally slice of life kinda thing? No super huge plot points. But I do remember her dress. Her favourite dress had cows on it, and on one occasion, she dropped a cigarette in her lap while distracted and nearly burnt a hole in it. \n\nThere's a chance the main character's name may have been Andrea, but I have a vivid memory of me telling my mother that \"The girl on the cover looks just like my cousin\", who's name is Andrea. The cover itself was generally brightly coloured, with a picture of a girl on it, taken from a sort of top view? She was also wearing a dress that I thinkwas pink and had strawberries on it. \n\nAt some point in the book, she lost her virginity on a dock, in a sleeping bag, and remarked on how she made the steretypical \"oh\" noise when she finished.
