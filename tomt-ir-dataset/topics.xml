    <title>claymation kids show with british narrator dog kid penguin in white void</title>
    <description>Nick Jr. claymation show? I have one vague memory of a claymation kid’s show. It had a dog character, possibly a kid character(unsure), and a British narrator. I think it also had a penguin character that had a hat that did some crazy things. Also I think the show always took place in a white void. Don’t get it twisted though, I’m not thinking of that claymation penguin “noot noot” show.</description>

    <description>I look for a website that sells T-shirts, bags, and posters that had a whole book written on them.</description>
    <narrative>A relevant website allows to buy t-shirts, bags, and posters with a complete book written on it. Highly relevant are documents on the domain litographs.com, relevant are documents that talk about litographs.com or a similar page.</narrative>

    <title>dutch dystopian webcomic having a white lavender color scheme in a snowy setting</title>
    <description>A Dutch (maybe) Webcomic. A couple of my Dutch-speaking (I'm not even sure about that maybe even Finnish) friends recommended a Webcomic to me on Teamspeak and I remember the first page having a white/lavender color scheme in a snowy setting. I remember something about releasing two or three pages a week but when I saw it on April I believe they took a month break or something. I don't remember the plot, they just told me to read it. I can't get into contact with them anymore so I can't ask but I think the genre was dystopian.</description>

    <title>search engine for pictures of a predominant color</title>
    <description>A website where you can pick colors and it gives you a picture of something that is predominantly that color. I think I first saw it on a vsauce3 dong video. Basically you have a color palette arhat you choose from and it gives you a picture or a flower or something that is mostly the color that you choose. Sorry, I basically said the exact same thing over again but I don't know how else to explain it.</description>
